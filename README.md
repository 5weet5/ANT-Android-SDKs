# ANT and ANT+ Android SDKs
The Android ANT and Android ANT+ SDKs enable developers to create unique applications that use ANT wireless communication technology to communicate between a wide array of devices over various network configurations. ANT is a proven ultra-low power wireless sensor network protocol operating in the 2.4 GHz ISM band and is an effective solution for personal and local area networks. ANT is available on many Android devices including most modern flagship phones from Samsung and Sony. Additionally, ANT can be used on other devices with USB-Host support through the use of an ANT USB stick.

This SDK contains the required resources for developing ANT enabled applications on Android platforms:

* <b>ANT+ SDK (often reffered to as the 'ANT+ Plugins')</b> enables Android developers to easily connect to ANT+ certified devices through a high level, intuitive API. The ANT+ SDK abstracts the connection and pairing process and decoding data into easy to use functions and events.

* <b>ANT SDK (often reffered to as the 'AntLib' or 'ANT channels interface')</b> For use cases that are not addressed by existing ANT+ device profiles, developers can use the AntLib to communicate directly with the ANT protocol and create and connect to custom ANT networks. The SDK provides an easy to use API that allows your application to use multiple ANT channels, even if other running applications are currently using ANT channels.
